  = Let’s Help Adolescents

  Whether they are male or female, adolescents feel like deciding on everything themselves in spite of parents’ instruction, especially when they face problems like sex, mental stress, etc., which make them feel ashamed and embarrassed. Thus they often automatically get into troubles due to their imperfect comprehension and judgement. Some are addicted to cigarettes, only several packets of which will hurt their lungs and make them breathless quickly. Others can’t quit drinking alcohol, whose harmful effects include causing young pregnant women to abort or give birth to abnormal babies. The worst is drug abuse, for the withdrawal is tough once their bodies are accustomed to the drugs. Meanwhile, those who share needles bought from illegal chemists are at great risk of being infected with desperate AIDS. If so, neither injecting nor taking pills can guarantee their survival.

  However, don’t be disappointed at or have prejudice against our children so easily. After all, being awkward is an appendix of youth. As long as we strengthen communication with them instead of only banning this or banning that, we will surely help them avoid anything unfit.

  = 帮助青少年

  不论男女，青少年们都喜欢不顾家长的指导，自己对一切作决定，特别是当他们面对如性、心理压力等等一些使他们觉得羞愧和尴尬的问题时更是如此。因此，由于他们理解力和判断力的不足，他们常常会无意识地陷入困境中。有的对香烟上瘾，只要几包就会对他们的肺造成损害，使他们很容易就气喘吁吁；有的没法戒除酒精带来的不良后果，包括造成年轻的怀孕女性流产或生下不正常的婴儿；最糟糕的是滥用毒品，因为一旦他们的身体对毒品习惯了，要想戒毒就相当困难了。同时，那些共用从非法药剂师处购买的注射器的青少年冒着感染令人绝望的艾滋病的极大风险，一旦感染上，不管是打针还是吃药都没法保证他们的生存了。

  然而，请不要轻易就对我们的孩子失望或抱有偏见，毕竟，不成熟是年轻的必然附属品。只要我们加强和他们的沟通，而不是仅仅禁止这样，不准那样，我们一定能帮助他们避开不健康的东西。
