= Study in America

Nannan’s father runs an enterprise near the Ming Tombs selling batteries and drills to the Daqing Oilfield. Hoping to get the qualification to help govern it, Nannan made much preparation and then left her motherland with her visa to study in America. Having reached her destination, she settled in an inn recommended by the travel agent.

As far as Nannan was concerned, she always kept it up in China. But she had to acknowledge it was not easy to adjust herself to the new academic requirements, which were not parallel with China’s. Though she was occupied with lectures and seminars day in and day out, the essays she drafted were still contradicted by her tutors. As for her routine life, she felt that it was hard to fit in, too. For example, she found English idioms difficult to understand. And it was out of the question to eat delicious Chinese foods though many optional cafeterias served abundant substitutes. In addition, she had to wait in a queue early for the minibus that took her to school and it was usually so cold that she felt numb. What bothered her most was that she received no apology when her sleeping was disturbed by a barking dog in a shopkeeper’s cage.

Luckily, with her parents comforting her by videophone, she became autonomous soon and eventually got her bachelor’s degree successfully.

= 留学美国

楠楠的父亲在明陵附近经营一家企业，销售电池和钻机到大庆油田。抱着获得相应资格帮助管理的希望，楠楠做了大量准备，然后带着签证离开祖国去美国留学。抵达目的地后，她在一间旅行代理推荐的旅馆安顿下来。

就楠楠而言，她在国内一直保持着良好的状态，但是在国外，她却不得不承认，要适应新学院的要求不容易，它们和国内的要求不相同。尽管她整天都忙着听讲座、参加研讨会努力学习，她起草的论文还是被导师驳了回来。至于日常生活，她也感觉难于适应，例如，她发觉英语成语很难理解，而且不可能吃到地道的中国食品，尽管可选的许多餐馆都有提供丰富的替代品。此外，她还得冒着把人冻得麻木的寒冷早起排队等小型巴士去学校。最使她烦恼的是，一名店主笼子里的狗的吠叫闹得她睡不好觉，但却没有任何人向她道歉。

幸运的是，在她父母通过可视电话的安慰下，她很快就锻炼得自主独立起来，并最终成功获得了学士学位。
