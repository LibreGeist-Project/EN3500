= A Fair Competition

Swifter, Higher and Stronger stands for the spirit of the Olympics. But fairness is the basis of this motto. Only when you win fairly will you and your homeland deserve the great glory. But nowadays, unlike the ancient honest slave competitors, some hopeless athletes who can’t bear the pain of training cheat when taking part in games. Medals seem to have magical power causing them to cheat, and the prize money has replaced the motto as their only goal.

So, in the gymnastics event to be held in our city next month, one of the host’s responsibilities is to keep competitions fair. They advertised on posters outside the stadium to promise that every competitor is to have a regular physical examination in a gymnasium one after another. No one can bargain on this. The volunteers in charge will be very strict. It is foolish to cheat because they will not be admitted to compete and will even be fined as well.

= 公平的比赛

“更快！更高！更强！”代表着奥运精神。但是公平却是这一格言的基础。只有当你公平地赢得比赛，你和你的祖国才会承受这样的光荣。但如今，不像古代那些诚实的奴隶参赛者，有些没有希望的运动员无法承受训练的痛苦，于是在参加比赛时作假。奖牌似乎有某种魔力使他们作假，奖金也已经代替了奥运格言成为了他们唯一的目标。

因此，在我们市下个月即将举行的一场体操赛事中，主办方的其中一项责任就是要确保比赛的公平。他们在体育场外的海报上做广告，承诺说每个参赛者都将在体育馆一个一个地参加常规的身体检查。对此没有人可以讨价还价。负责此事的志愿者将非常严格。作假是很愚蠢的，因为他们将不被允许去竞赛，甚至还将被罚款。
