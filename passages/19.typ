= A Misunderstanding

In general, spoken statements are the major way of communication, but body language and facial expressions also have such kinds of function. For example, yawning means being not interested and turning one’s back to someone or swinging your fist shows your anger. But what those gestures really mean is subjective in different cultures. Thus, misunderstandings happen now and then in today’s world of cultural crossroads.

Once, representing the Adults’ Education Association, I went to the airport to meet an official of high rank from Columbia and take him to his dormitory and then to the canteen. After the flight arrived, I saw a man looking around curiously. So I approached to greet him. He suddenly dashed to hug me and kissed me on both cheeks. As a young girl, I felt truly embarrassed and put up my hands to defend myself. His false smile told me that he had lost face.

Later, I received a cassette from him, in which he recorded his apology. On hearing that Columbians were more likely to kiss others, I soon felt at ease.

= 一场误会

通常说来，口头表达是人们交流的主要方法，但是肢体语言和面部表情也有这种功能。例如，打哈欠意味着不感兴趣，背对别人或向其挥舞拳头表达的是愤怒。但是在不同的文化中那些手势表达的真正意思是很主观的。由此，误会就时不时地发生在今天这个文化交叉碰撞的世界里。

有一回，我代表成人教育协会到机场去接一位从哥伦比亚来的高级官员，我得带他到宿舍和食堂。当他的航班到达时，我看见一名男子好奇地东张西望，于是走上前去和他打招呼。他突然猛冲过来拥抱我，还亲了我的脸颊。还是个年轻姑娘的我感到真尴尬，不由自主举起手来保护自己。他的假笑告诉我他感到丢了面子。

后来，我收到他送来的一盒磁带，里面录了他的道歉。当听到这只是因为哥伦比亚人更倾向于见面时互相亲吻时，我很快就感到轻松安心了。
