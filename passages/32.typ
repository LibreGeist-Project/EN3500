  = Happy Marriage Needs Fighting for

  As a talented navy officer, he was bound to be busy. When his wife rang him up to declare her divorce alarm, he was still scanning a digital counter to check the data so as to give an assessment of the theoretical framework for a biochemical weapon. His junior staff’s sympathy made him feel embarrassed.

  His wife was a part-time clerk. With his high bonus, she lived in a grand house with elegant cushions and bedding. Her favour was reading stars’ biographies or absurd fictions with endless chapters in her armchair. People envied her leisure life very much. But in fact, she was tired of being left alone. She sent emails to his mailbox every week to state her thinking and ask for his accompaniment, but never received reply of satisfaction. Tired of his explanation that he must obey the orders, she filed for divorce.


  Because he desired to get their holy affection back, he set other affairs aside. He trimmed his fingernails short and changed his overweight figure as well as his awful haircut. He wore an apron to prepare delicious cuisine for her. He also bought her a necklace and piles of flowers hoping that their receiver could turn around.

  After being tested out for 3 months in all, he eventually succeeded.

  = 幸福的婚姻需要争取

  作为一名才华出众的海军军官，他注定是要忙碌的。当他的妻子打来电话宣布和他离婚的警告时，他还在查看一台数码计数器核对数据，以对一种生物化学武器的理论框架做出评估。他的下级职员表现出的同情使他很尴尬。

  他的妻子是一位非全日性工作的职员，有了他的高津贴，她住在一所装饰有优雅垫子和寝具的富丽堂皇的屋子里。她的爱好是坐在扶手椅上读读明星们的传记或一些有没完没了章节的荒谬小说。别人都很妒忌她安逸的生活，但是实际上，她厌透了被独自丢下。她每周都给他的邮箱发电子邮件陈述她的想法，要求他的陪伴，但却从未收到满意答复。受够了他总是必须服从命令的解释，她提出了离婚。

  因为渴望重新获得这份神圣的爱，他把别的事务都放在一边。他剪短了指甲，改变了超重的身材和糟糕的发型，还穿上围裙为她做可口的菜肴，他甚至还给她买了项链和成堆的鲜花，希望它们的接受者能够回心转意。

  在被考验了总共3个月后，他最终成功了。
