  = Defeat Disability

  Feeling clumsy, he was annoyed at first though nobody made fun of him. He cut out going outdoors and just sat around at home talking to his parrot or tortoise silently. His sister resigned to help him in many ways. Her assistance and encouragement were so beneficial to his psychology that he adapted to his disability soon and became outgoing again. In a college accessible to him, he studied politics and literature. He always sat in the front row near the entry without any absence and, with the help of his handy laptop, he studied well by means of dictation. His thesis, Abolishing Slavery, met with all professors’ approval. After class, he and his companions often played drum music, which was noisy but suitable for his hearing. After graduation, he made high profits by designing software for a firm. All in all, in his community, he won his dignity and people’s congratulations.

  He always wished all the best to his disabled fellows and encouraged them, “Never mind! All you have is adequate to get your achievement.”
  
  Yang’s ambition was to get an architect certificate or become a bowling master. But when he was conducting experiments with a microscope in the basement, a tank on the bench exploded, sending him flying outwards through the exit. He was out of breath while knowing he lost his eyesight as well as 70% of his hearing. In other words, he was disabled.

  = 战胜残疾

  阳的雄心是，要么获得一张建筑师证书，要么成为一名保龄球高手。但是在地下室里的显微镜下进行试验时，放在长凳上的一只大桶突然爆炸，把他从出口处炸飞了出去。当知道自己除了失去70%的听力之外，还失去了视力时，他完全喘不过气来。换句话说，他残疾了。

  最初，尽管没人取笑他，他还是非常气恼于自己的笨拙。他取消了外出，总是在家里闲坐，和他的鹦鹉和乌龟默默相对。他的姐姐辞了职，用许多方式帮助他。她的帮助和鼓励对他的心理是如此地有益，以致他很快就适应了自己的残疾，再次变得外向起来。他在一所接受他就读的学校里学习政治和文学，总是坐在靠近入口的前排，从不缺席。在他轻便好用的手提电脑的帮助下，他用听写的方式学习得很好。他的论文《废除奴隶制》受到所有教授的一致认可。课后，他和伙伴们还常常演奏大声却适合他听觉的鼓乐。毕业后，他通过设计软件为一家公司获得很高的利润。总之，在他的社区里，他赢得了自己的尊严和人们的祝贺。

  他一直都把所有最好祝愿给予他残疾的同伴，并鼓励他们：“没关系，你拥有的一切一定足够你取得自己的成就！”
