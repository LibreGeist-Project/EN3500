= Fall in Love with English

Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain, a teenager packed up his overcoat into the suitcase. He planned to leave home at dusk though there was thunder and lightning outdoors. He had got to do this because he was tired of his parents’ nagging about his English study and did not want to go through it any longer. He couldn’t get along well with English and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignored him on purpose. As a result, his score in each exam never added up to over 60.

His partner was concerned about him very much. She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but entirely disagreed with his idea. In order to calm him down and settle his problem, she talked with him face to face and swapped a series of learning tips with him. The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.

The teenager was grateful and got great power from his friend’s words. Now, he has recovered from being upset and has fallen in love with English.

有个少年躲在积满灰尘的松散窗帘后把大衣装入手提箱。尽管外面正打雷闪电， 他仍计划在黄昏时分离家出走。他不得不这样做是因为厌倦了父母对他英语学习的唠叨，不想再忍受下去了。他的英语学习总是无法取得进展，而且不喜欢参加英语课的学习，因为他以为老师有意忽视他。结果，他每次考试的分数合计从未超过60。

他的搭档很关心他，也确切地理解他遭受的折磨，但却完全不同意他的想法。为了使他冷静下来好好解决问题，她和他面对面地交谈，并交换了一系列的学习心得技巧。她写下来的条款帮助他找到了学好英语的最佳捷径。

这个少年非常很感激，并从朋友的话里获得极大的动力。现在，他已经从沮丧中恢复过来，真正爱上了英语。
