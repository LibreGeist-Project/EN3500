= A Russian Poem

Since childhood, Anton had often recited poems, accompanied by pianists and violinists, at wedding ceremonies before brides and bridegrooms exchanged rings. Gradually, he found writing poems the most appropriate way to convey his joy and sorrow. When his poem Contradictory Blank won him a national championship and a scholarship to the Moscow University from a sponsor, he was just an unknown librarian. After getting his diploma, he devoted his life to writing poems. Using concrete but flexible language and the minimum of words is his style. He tried out different patterns and preferred nursery rhyme in particular. The following is a translation of one of his works made up of 3 sections:

Little sparrow with heavy load,Ran out of energy and very cold;No compass and all sweat salty,Can you go through the endless darkness?Little balloon let out by the thread,Flew over cottages and was very glad; With warmth transformed from sunlight,He said he could forever fly;Take it easy, little balloon;Don’t tease the sparrow with his wound;On the bare branch and have a rest;This diamond heart will eventually get success.

从童年时起，安东就常常在钢琴师或小提琴师的伴奏下在婚礼上朗诵诗歌，为新郎新娘交换戒指前的仪式助兴。渐渐地，他发现写诗是表达他的欢乐和悲伤的最合适方式。在他还是个寂寞无闻的图书管理员时，他的诗《矛盾的空白》就获得了全国诗歌创作冠军，并为他赢得一位赞助人提供的奖学金，到莫斯科大学深造。获得文凭后，他将一生都投入到诗歌创作中。使用具体而灵活的语言和最少的词语数量是他的风格，他还喜欢尝试不同的诗歌形式，特别是童谣。下面由三部分组成的译文就是他的作品中的一首：

小麻雀，负重担， 小气球，脱绳系， 别紧张，小气球

筋疲力尽挡风寒， 飞越农舍真高兴， 别笑麻雀伤口留，

汗水成盐无指引， 阳光给予它温暖， 光光的树梢歇片刻，

能否穿越无边暗？ 永远高飞不费力； 恒（钻石）心终把成功求。
