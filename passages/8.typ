= Computers

The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums. But with the help of new technology, electronic chips replaced tubes and a revolution of artificial intelligence has arisen. From then on, the appearance of computers totally changed our lives. They can not only download information from the wet when connected by the network or mobile phone signals, but also solve different types of logical problems. With operators as their coaches, they can even control rockets to explore the moon and instruct androids with the human race’s characters to mop floors and watch over your naughty niece. Anyhow, computers are so helpful that they do bring happiness.

However, computers are easily attacked by viruses. This reality has become a hard-to-deal with-problem. As a result, computers are dangerous in a way. So, personally, I worry about their universal applications in some fields, such as finance.

早期计算机器的目的是简化比较难的计算。但是在新技术的帮助下，电子芯片代替了电子管，一场人工智能革命由此掀起。从那时起，电脑的出现完全改变了我们的生活，它们不仅能在网络或移动电话信号的连接下从网上下载信息，而且可以解决各种类型的逻辑问题。在操作员的教练下，它们甚至还可以控制火箭探索月球，指导具有人类性格的机器人擦洗地板和照顾你调皮的侄女。不管怎么说，电脑都是如此的有用，以致的确给人们带来了快乐。

然而，电脑很容易受到病毒的攻击，这一现实已经成为一个难以处理的难题，结果，电脑在某种程度上是很危险的。因此，就个人而言，我很担心电脑在某些领域，例如金融方面的广泛应用。
