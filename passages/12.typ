  = Balanced Diet
  
  Wang Peng earned his living by running a barbecue restaurant, which served delicious bacon, fried chicken breast and mutton roasted with pepper and garlic. But his food and discount attracted fewer and fewer customers. Finally, he was in debt. Yong Hui’s slimming restaurant served fresh peas, carrots, eggplants, and raw cucumbers with vinegar. As the hostess, she said fibres benefited customers' digestion the most. In order not to let Yong Hui get away with telling

  lies, Wang Peng spied on Yong Hui despite her glare. But he was surprised that she was losing her customers, too.

  Curiosity drove Wang Peng to consult an expert. The expert sighed and said, “Both of your menus have weakness and limited strength. Your customers put on weight too easily, while Yong Hui’s lose weight too quickly. So, Wang Peng, cut down the fat of your food and increase vegetables and fruits, like nuts, beans, mushrooms, peaches and lemons. You ought to combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet.”

  Before long, Wang Peng won his customers back.

  = 平衡膳食
  
  王鹏经营一家烧烤餐厅来谋生，他的餐厅供应美味的腊肉、油炸的鸡胸，还有用辣椒和大蒜一起烤制的羊肉。但是，他的食物和折扣吸引的顾客越来越少，最后是他负债累累。永慧的减肥餐厅供应的是新鲜的豌豆、红萝卜、茄子和醋腌的生黄瓜。作为老板娘（女主人），她总是说食物纤维才最有利于顾客的消化。为了不让永慧说了谎不受惩罚，王鹏不顾她的怒视，前去探查个究竟。但是让他惊奇的是，永慧的顾客也在严重地流失。

  好奇心驱使王鹏去咨询专家。那位专家叹息着说：“你们俩的菜单都缺点明显、优点有限。你的顾客很容易就发胖，而永慧的顾客体重却减轻得太快。所以嘛，王鹏，你要减少你的食物中的脂肪含量，增加蔬菜和水果，例如坚果、豆类、蘑菇、桃子和柠檬之类。你应该把两份菜单结合起来，给顾客提供平衡的膳食。”

  不久，王鹏就赢回了他的顾客。
