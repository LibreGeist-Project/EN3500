  = A Journey across Canada

  After a quiz last autumn, Kuang crossed the continent eastward to Toronto to visit his schoolmate, the distance measuring approximately 5,000 kilometers,

  His train started from Vancouver, a city surrounded by mountains. After confirming his baggage was aboard the train, Kuang settled down in his seat. Having a gift for communication, he started chatting with another passenger within 5 minutes. Their topics included the Canadian traditions, the Prime Minister, the mixture of races, and the terrifying Great Fall. After a nice buffet at noon, he was pleased to find that the scenery was impressive. He saw beautiful harbours in the distance, wealthy urban areas and maple forest that covered thousands of acres. He even managed to catch sight of an eagle flying upward over bushes.

  Kuang reached Toronto which lies slightly near the border at a misty dawn. There was frost and the broad downtown streets were very quiet. Though it was early, Kuang phoned his schoolmate in a booth nearby at once rather than waiting for him to come. They had a good time together.

  = 横穿加拿大的旅行

  去年秋天的一次考试后，光向东横穿整个大陆，来到多伦多探望他的同学，这次旅行的距离测量起来大约有五千多公里。

  他的火车从群山围绕的温哥华启程。在证实了自己的行李都在火车上之后，光就在座位上安坐下来。因为在与人交流方面有天赋，他在5分钟内就和另一个乘客聊起天来。他们的话题包括加拿大的传统、加拿大的总理、种族的混合，还有让人心惊胆战的大瀑布。中午吃了一顿美味的自助餐后，他很高兴发现外面的风景非常让人印象深刻。他看见了远处美丽的海港、富裕的市区，还有延绵几千亩的枫树林，他甚至还设法看见了一只在灌木丛上空翱翔的鹰。

  光在一个薄雾笼罩的黎明到达稍稍接近边境的多伦多，地上有霜，宽阔的市区街道很安静。尽管还很早，光却不愿等待，立刻就在附近电话亭给同学打了个电话。他们在一起度过了美好的时光。
