  = Immigrate to America 移民美国

  At first, he made a living by means of raising cattle and then was hired in aircraft industries. He lived in a Catholic district. Taking in a small percentage of Pakistani immigrants, the majority of the residents were from Italy and Denmark, who all kept up their customs and cultures. Different blocks here were distinctly marked out and indicated from the racial angle. It was unfair and needed reforming. But with nowhere else to go, my nephew lived on and managed to make a life for himself.

  My nephew’s fortune came when he bravely helped a conductor brake a ream to stop it from slipping out of the rails. The man was elected vice chairman of the Socialist Party later. It occurred to my nephew that he could grasp this opportunity to ask for his help. The man who was thankful helped him apply to the civil authority for the right to live in America by inserting his brave deed into his documents. Unlike a great many other applicants, his application was approved by the Federal Justice Ministry. Before long, he started his own bakery and lived a better life.

  = Attracted by the boom in America, my nephew teamed up with a Korean to illegally cross the Bearing Strait in the Arctic to America. To avoid the Customs’ punishment, they hid in a small ferry called the North Pole Seagull, sitting back to back without sleeping, showering and shaving for 3 days, and had no chance to mourn their lost luggage when landing. The hardship of this crossing was apparent.

  因为受到美国繁荣的吸引，我的侄子与一名韩国人合作，从北极的白令海峡偷渡到美国。为了避开海关的惩处，他们躲在一艘叫“北极海鸥”的渡轮里，背靠背坐着，整整3天没有睡觉、洗澡和刮胡子，上岸的时候也没有机会心痛他们丢失的行李，这次横渡的艰辛是显而易见的。

  起初，他借助饲养牲畜谋生，后来受雇于飞机制造工业。他住的地方是一个天主教区，除了包括一小部分（百分比）的巴基斯坦移民，大部分的居民都来自于意大利和丹麦，他们都保持着自己的风俗和文化，使这里的街区都从种族的角度清楚地划出界线，明确标示。这很不公平，极需改革，但我的侄子没别的地方可去，只好继续居住下去，想法设法开始新的生活。

  我侄子的好运在他勇敢地帮助一名列车员刹停一列电车以防止其滑出轨道时到来了。那个人后来被选为社会党的副主席，我侄子就想到应该抓住机会请求他的帮助。这个人充满感激，立即把我侄子的勇敢事迹插入到申请文件中，帮助我侄子向美国国内政权当局申请美国居住权。不像别的许多申请人，我侄子的申请很快被联邦司法部批准了。不久，他就开了自己的面包店，过上了稍好一点的生活。
