= A Hard Trip

My sister was fond of traveling. Ever since graduating, she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple. Since transporting fare was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about the disadvantages. Her stubborn attitude was always her shortcoming. Once she made up her mind to do something, no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally, we gave in as usual though we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything, including the schedule, reliable weather forecast and the insurance, we began our trip.

 Our journey was along a river flowing from a high altitude. Our pace was slow because the river frequently had many sharp bends through deep valleys, where the water seemed to boil. Just as I recorded in my journal, it was really a hard journey. But we also enjoyed great views. One night, I put my head on my pillow--a parcel of wool coats, and lay beneath the stars. When the flame in front of our cave went out at midnight, I found the sky so beautiful!

= 一次辛苦的旅行

我的妹妹很喜欢旅行。自从毕业以来，她就下定决心要组织一次往一座古庙的旅行。因为交通费用昂贵，她决定骑自行车去，毫不担心其中的不利情况。顽固的态度一直都是她的缺点，一旦她下定决心要做的事，就没有人能说服她改变主意。最后，我们像往常一样让步，尽管我们更喜欢乘火车去。我们准备好了所有东西，包括时间表、可靠的天气预报，还有保险，就开始了旅程。

我们的旅程沿着一条从高海拔处流下来的河流前行。但我们的步伐很慢，因为当流经深深的峡谷时，这条河流急转弯很多，急湍的河水都似乎沸腾起来。正如我在旅行日志里记录的那样，这真是一次艰苦的旅行。但是我们也欣赏到了美丽的景色。一天晚上，我把头枕在一包羊毛衣服做的枕头上，躺在星空下，当岩洞前的火焰在午夜熄灭时，我发现夜空是如此的美丽！
