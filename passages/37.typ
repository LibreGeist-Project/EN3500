  = Be Careful about Cloning

  After a series of initial experiments and corrections, the scientist’s hard work paid off when the twin clone turkeys were hatched with normal feather and claws. This breakthrough possibly enabled people to bring their adored pets back to life. However, it bothered him from time to time that their health was in poor condition because they were unable to resist illnesses. This drawback cast him down. Merely 2 weeks later, the clones and their carrier died, which struck frustration into his heart. He retired before he attained his ambition and became a member of an opera chorus to relieve his depression.

  Shortly afterwards, the media published a conservative argument objecting to cloning owing to moral problems, and suggested the constitution include compulsory regulations to forbid obtaining commercial profits from cloning.

  When interviewed, the scientist stared at the decorations on the ceiling, thinking for a while, and then said, “I’m not in favour of any arbitrary assumption, but undertaking cloning does differ from the straightforward procedure of making loafs out of flour. Until we accumulate enough exact knowledge, any practice is in vain and is bound to fail. Altogether, being more careful is reasonable or we may walk into a side road.”

  = 谨慎对待克隆

  在最初一系列的实验和修正之后，科学家的辛苦工作终于取得了成功，一对双生的克隆火鸡孵化出来，羽毛和爪子都很正常。这一突破或许能让人们使他们喜爱的宠物死而复生。然而，使他不时地烦恼的是，因为它们无法抵抗疾病，使得它们的健康状况极差。这个缺点让他很沮丧。仅仅过了2个星期，克隆体和母体都死亡了，这使他内心里充满了挫折，他也因此在达到自己目标前就退休了，并选择加入歌剧合唱团来减轻消沉的感觉。

  之后不久，媒体就因为道德问题而发表了反对克隆的保守论点，并且建议宪法应该包括强制性的法规禁止通过克隆获得商业利益。

  当被采访时，科学家盯着天花板上的装饰物思考了一会儿，说：“我不赞成任何任意的假设，但是从事克隆与用面粉制作面包的简单过程确实不大相同。在我们积累了足够的准确知识前，任何实际操作都是徒劳无功的，注定会失败。总而言之，更加谨慎地对待克隆是合理的，否则我们或许会误入歧途。”
