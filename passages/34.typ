  = Helping the Remote Village

  A year ago, the famous astronaut received an invitation by airmail from a remote village. Intending to sniff some fresh air, he and his interpreter paid a fortnight visit there. It was a privilege for them to be there, but they were shocked by what they saw. The tracks were muddy. The river was drying up. Most villagers only possessed one broom, a few tins and several jars and their rectangular grass huts with round angles were surrounded by weeds. Besides, their school had no roof and platform, and the students had no concept of clicking a computer at all. They were badly in need.

  Soon, the astronaut made a generous voluntary donation to the village. There were textbooks for students, sewing machines for tailors and tractors for farmers. His distribution catalogue also included operating a clinic and a trunk library, as well as giving weekly lessons to teach relevant farming knowledge like how to dry out seeds or raise oxen. He himself not only helped do some paperwork but also purchased grills for boys to toast potatoes and combs for girls who were dying to get one. The other day, he heard from the villagers again inviting him to participate in the donation anniversary. For political and security reasons, he couldn’t adjust his outgoing arrangement-otherwise he would go. But his deeds were remembered forever.

  = 援助山村

  一年前，那位著名的宇航员收到一份由一个偏远村庄通过航空邮件寄来的邀请。因为想要呼吸一下新鲜空气，他和翻译到那儿做了一次两周的访问。当地之行使他们倍感荣幸，但却震惊于所见所闻。泥泞的道路、河流干枯，大部分的村民拥有的财产只不过是一只扫帚、几个瓶瓶罐罐而已，圆角的矩形草屋四周长满了杂草，学校也没有屋顶和讲台，学生们更对点击操作电脑毫无概念。他们生活确实相当困难。

  很快，宇航员就向村庄做了慷慨的自愿捐赠。捐赠品中有给学生的课本，给裁缝的缝纫机，还有给农民的拖拉机。捐赠金的分配目录中还包括一间诊所和一间书箱图书馆的运作，并有传授像怎么使种子干透，或者怎么养牛这种相关农业知识的每周课程。他自己不仅亲自帮助做一些文书工作，还给男孩子们购买了烤马铃薯的烤架、给渴望得到梳子的女孩子们买了梳子。前几天，他又收到了村民们邀请他参加捐赠周年会的来信。出于政治和安全原因，他无法调整外出时间安排，否则他就会去了。不过他所做的一切村民们都永远记得。
